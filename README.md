#### Installation
This project is still in the alpha phase. This framework is built using the SASS (a css preprocessor).

Since npm package isn't published yet, use above installation steps to use the css files in your project / to test it out.

1. Run npm installation ```npm install```

2. Now run ```gulp``` in the termainal after npm installs necessary packages. You'll have compiled css files in the '**dist**' folder. Test it out and see how it works for you!
